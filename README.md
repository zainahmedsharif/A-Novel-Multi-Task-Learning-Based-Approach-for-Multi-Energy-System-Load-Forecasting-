# A-Novel-Multi-Task-Learning-Based-Approach-to-Multi-Energy-System-Load-Forecasting
This repository contains the implementation of a novel multi-task learning-based approach for load forecasting in multi-energy systems (MES). The proposed deep learning model, D-TCNet, integrates Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) to forecast multiple energy loads (heating, cooling, electricity) simultaneously. By leveraging load correlations and advanced network architecture, the model improves the accuracy of load forecasting across all energy types and seasons. The dataset used for this research is from the University of Austin Tempe Campus, spanning the years 2016 to 2019.
